The difficult circumstances and the insecurity that reigned led the artists of the Capital to seek safer places and new markets. Crete, an island which had been under Venetian domination since 1210, and which was flourishing economically, was one such place. Archival sources mention at least six painters from Constantinople who lived and worked at Chandax (the medieval name for the present-day city of Herakleion in Crete) at the beginning of the 15th century; among them were John Apokaukos and Nicholas Philanthropenos. The wave of ""artistic migration"" which went on even after the fall of Constantinople to the Turks (1453), led to the spread of the art of the Capital to the island and was a contributing factor in the creation of a particular school of painting, known as the ""Cretan School"", which was to dominate the art scene of the post-Byzantine years.",1401-1450,"Tempera and leaf on panel, 121 x 96,5 cm"

Saint Peter, kneeling in the foreground, enveloped in his billowing garments, seems in fact to be acting on a stage. The setting, instead, is made pleasant and gracious thanks to an almost archaic use of perspective, to that sea rising high on the horizon, ruffled by light foaming waves, and to the small boat, tossed by the waters, brimming with small figures.",1551-1600,"Oil on copper, 47 x 40 cm"

The significance of the group of figures at the top - a bearded man with a boy shooting an arrow - is not clear, but appears to relate to ancient mythology. Beyond the fountain the wooded shores of a lake stretch far into the distance.

Images of St Sebastian bound to a tree and pierced with arrows had become increasingly popular from the fifteenth century on, partly because they gave artists an excuse to depict the male nude within a religious context. The inclusion of an angel tending the saint's wounds is very rare, but undoubtedly reflects devotional literature that recounted how Christ sent an angel to untie Sebastian and cure his wounds. The angel can also be linked to the contemporary cult of guardian angels, who were believed to take the outward appearance of youthful boys. Similar guardian angels can be found in Caravaggio's Stigmatisation of St Francis (Wadsword Atheneum, Hartford), Orazio Gentileschi's St Francis Supported by an Angel (Museo del Prado, Madrid), and Baglione's own St Francis Comforted by Two Angels (Private collection), which is dated 1601.",1601-1650,"Oil on canvas, 95,9 x 75,5 cm"

Indeed, in a painting like this the way that the gestures and looks of the characters link to each other shows that he studied his compositions carefully. But what he did not do was to show off cleverness for its own sake. The way that he accurately describes a number of details (the fruits, the metal objects, or the items in the bottom left corner) foreshadows the imminent developments that would give rise to the new (for Italy) genre of still-lifes.

The intensity of the background is to some extent dissipated by the foreground of the painting. Here the somewhat distracted and independent compositional device of the heads revolving around the Child suggests a desire to create an effect of distinction and beauty that the delicate forms can scarcely sustain. In the gestures of the hands plucking at the air or touching things without grasping them (the Madonna's carnation, St. Catherine's crucifix), there is almost the ingenuousness of a miniature painter.

But though the effect of light is depicted most exquisitely, there is very little plasticity in the representation of the face of the learned abbot which, in fact, almost merges into the radiance of the golden background. Of paramount importance to Bermejo was the representation of every detail of the embroidered cope, the splendid mitre, the amazingly intricate Gothic carving on the throne (itself almost an architectural feat) and every vein of the marble floor.

Once considered to all be by the same hand, the paintings in that group have now been separated into three different sets. The first and most consistent of these retains the name of the Candlelight Master, who has been identified as Bigot. The second set is attributed to a ""Maestro Jacopo"", author of a Pietà in the Passion Chapel of the church of Santa Maria in Aquiro. The remaining pictures of this group form a third, more diverse set that is attributed to the circle of Bigot. On the basis of convincing similarities with other confirmed works, most importantly the Crowning of Christ with the Crown of Thorns from Santa Maria in Aquiro, the National Gallery Saint Jerome has been placed in the category of original works by Bigot. The picture also has a pendant depicting Jerome's fellow-penitent St. Mary Magdalene, now in the Museum of Art at Ponce.",1601-1650,"Oil on canvas, 105 x 138 cm"

Nor is it only in the type of picture that the Budapest Madonna is related to  Leonardo. The subtlety of the detail, for instance the beauty of Mary's hands, the tender pose of the heads and the accomplished execution of the rich drapery, all provide evidence that the link with Leonardo is more than a matter of inspiration or borrowing of motifs.

At that time, the order's two founders, Felix de Valois and Jean de Matha, had not yet been canonised. They could only be worshiped in public after 1666, once the process had been completed. This did not mean, however, that a cult could not develop around them earlier. The order, established for the express purpose of buying the freedom of Christian slaves, was consecrated to the Holy Trinity. One of the most important 'new' saints of the period was Carlo Borromeo, who had been canonised in 1610. Borromeo came from Milan, which was then under Spanish rule. The Trinitarians, too, had close ties with Spain, and between 1598 and 1606 Borgianni himself had spent time in Pamplona, Madrid, Valladolid and Toledo. It is therefore not at all surprising that the commission for the recently finished church went to him, and that the church itself was not only dedicated to the Holy Trinity but to this new saint as well.",1601-1650,"Oil on canvas, 217 x 151 cm"

Christ's physical agony is heightened by the spike-studded wooden blocks which dangle fore and aft from his waist, lacerating his feet and ankles with every step. This cruel device was frequently represented by Dutch artists well into the sixteenth century. The high horizon is old-fashioned, as is the lack of spatial recession in the middle distance. In the foreground, soldiers torment the bad thief while the good thief kneels before a priest. The almost frantic intensity of his confession, well-expressed by the open-mouthed profile, contrasts vividly with the passive response of the priest who seems to suppress a yawn. The very presence of the priest is, of course, an anachronism, probably inspired by what Bosch had witnessed at contemporary executions; the same motif appears in the great multi-figure Christ Carrying the Cross which Pieter Bruegel the Elder was to paint almost a century later.",1451-1500,"Oil on panel, 57 c 32 cm"

His red cloak bunched up behind him, the giant Christopher staggers across the river, with the Christ Child on his back. According to legend, Christopher had served a king and the Devil himself in a search for a powerful and worthy master, a search which ended only when a hermit converted him to Christianity. The hermit stands at the edge of the water at lower right, but his treehouse has been transformed into a broken jug which houses a devilish tavern; above, a naked figure scrambles up a branch towards a beehive, a symbol of drunkenness. Across the river, a dragon emerges from a ruin, frightening a swimmer, while a town blazes in the shadowy distance.

The composition may well have been influenced by a painting done some years earlier by Geertgen tot Sint Jans. Geertgen represented the thoughtful prophet staring abstractedly into space, rubbing one foot against the other, but Bosch shows him pointing purposefully towards the Lamb of God crouching at lower right. This gesture traditionally identifies John as the forerunner of Christ, the 'precursor Christi'.

The antithesis between good and evil, which was so crucial to Christian belief in Bosch's time, is raised to a climax. The painting is a peerless study of human facial expressions and demonic visages. Yet the chaotic and caricatured elements are never overwhelming and the painting seems to observe a complex balance of parallels and contrasts that emphasizes the serenity of Christ's gently modelled face in the centre.

Christ dominates the foreground, almost crushed beneath the heavy Cross which the elderly Simon of Cyrene struggles to lift from his back. The ugly heads of his executioners rise steeply in a mass towards the left; in the distance, the sorrowing Virgin collapses into the arms of John the Evangelist. Whereas Bosch's earlier composition of this subject in Vienna had been diffuse and primarily narrative, the Madrid version is concentrated, and the way that Christ ignores his captors to look directly at the spectator gives it the quality of a timeless devotional image.",1451-1500,"Oil on panel, 150 x 94 cm"

Here Bruegel shows the two thieves who were to hang on either side of Christ being trundled to the place of execution. Both clutch crucifixes and are making their final confessions to the cowled priests beside them. The thieves, their confessors and the ghoulish spectators who surround the cart are all in contemporary dress. In Bruegel's day public executions were well attended occasions which had the air of festivals or carnivals. Here Bruegel shows the absolute indifference of the gawping crowds to the fear and misery of the condemned men.

Patenier's followers - in particular Herri met de Bles, Matthys Cock (the brother of Bruegel's print publisher, Hieronymus) and Cornelis Massys - had turned his style into a popular but stale formula.

On this occasion, however, there are none of the usual signs of a religious scene such as a halo. A young girl, seen from above, is seated on a low stool in one of Caravaggio's favourite cave-like settings, with a triangle of light high up on the wall behind her. Discarded jewellery - a string of pearls, clasps, a jar (perhaps holding precious ointment) - lies on the floor. The girl's hair is loose, as if it has just been washed. Her costume, consisting of a white-sleeved blouse, a yellow tunic and a flowery skirt, is rich. Bellori, who gives a careful description of this picture, which he came across in the collection of Prince Pamphilj, regards its title as an excuse; for him it is just a naturalistic portrayal of a pretty girl. This seems to show a willful failure to understand Caravaggio's intention or the wishes of the man who commissioned it, Monsignor Petrignani. The repentant Mary Magdalene, like the repentant Peter, was a favourite subject of Counter-Reformation art and poetry, which valued the visible expression of the state of contrition 'the gift of tears'. Caravaggio's heroine is sobbing silently to herself and a single tear falls down her cheek. She is, as it were, poised between her past life of luxury and the simple life she will embrace as one of Christ's most faithful followers. It is a sign of the painter's skill that he makes this inner conflict moving at the same time as he makes its representation delectable.",1551-1600,"Oil on canvas, 123 x 99 cm"

The decorative scheme called for a statue of St Matthew and the Angel, commissioned first to Gerolamo Muziano, and then to the Flemish sculptor Cobaert, for the high altar; and for a fresco cycle for the walls and ceiling by Cavalier d'Arpino. The latter decorated the vault in 1591-93, but the walls were left bare (this may reflect at least in part the Crescenzis' intentions to speculate on the interest on the Contarelli estate). On 13 June 1599 a contract was stipulated before a notary by which Caravaggio undertook to execute two paintings for the lateral walls, for which he was paid the following year (1600), after the paintings had been set in place. Later, on 7 February 1602, after Cobaert's statue had been judged unsatisfactory, an altarpiece was entrusted to Caravaggio in a separate contract that called for delivery of the work by 32 May, the Feast of the Pentecost.

Although Carpaccio's settings are entirely Venetian in spirit, they are complete fantasies and any reference to reality is scrupulously avoided.

This is probably what led to a relationship between the cardinal and the Emilian painter, resulting in the former commissioning a painting entitled Domine quo vadis? (now in the National Gallery in London) from the artist the following year. He also asked him to decorate, between 1603 and 1604, six lunettes in his private chapel. This no longer exists, but at the time was located in what is today the private entrance to the apartment of Palazzo Doria Pamphilj al Corso. An old plan shows that it had three entrances and six walls of different sizes, two large, two middle-sized, and two small, on which the six lunettes were placed. The Flight into Egypt, one of the two biggest, was probably located on the wall in front of the altar, to the right of the entrance that led into what is now the Aldobrandini room. It is very likely that Annibale Carracci had made the designs for all six of the canvases, but when he fell ill in 1605, the commission passed to his assistant Francesco Albani, who received the first payment in that year. Shortly afterwards, on May 21 1606, Pietro Aldobrandini, who had fallen out with Paul V, left Rome and did not return until 1610.

On the basis of the identification of the standing young man to the right as the artist's self portrait, a dating to the end of the 1640's was also proposed. This dating is compatible with the apparent age of the ""self-portrait"", as Cavallino would have been just over thirty years old at that time.

Few of the millions of visitors to Rome now realise, for example, that the great Baroque dome and vault decorations of the city's churches, flooded with heavenly light and dizzying crowds of saints and angels, emulate Correggio's frescoes of a hundred years earlier, through the agency of Lanfranco, a painter from Parma.

For this small altarpiece, Correggio draws inspiration from a miraculous episode narrated in the apocryphal gospel of pseudo-Matthew: Mary stopped to rest under a date palm and, seeing it full of fruits, she asked Joseph to pick some. However, considering the fruits were too high to reach, Joseph replied they should rather think about finding some water. Jesus then asked the palm to bend its branches so they could refresh themselves with its fruits, and at its roots there appeared a spring of clear water. Correggio paints the moment when Joseph, still holding a branch, offers Jesus some fruits. The intimate dimension of the event is rendered in the serenity of affections within the family group in everyday life, amidst luxuriant natural surroundings (in this case the welcoming shade of the palm tree and of the oak grove).",1501-1550,"Oil on canvas, 120 x 105 cm"

David deemphasized this miracle by giving Joseph a sturdy stick and by replacing the date palm with a Flemish chestnut tree, but a sixteenthcentury audience would have remembered the apocryphal story.

He heard a voice saying: ""Hubert, unless thou turnest to the Lord and leadest a holy life, thou shalt quickly go down into Hell."" Hubert dismounted and prostrated himself, and after asking ""Lord, what wouldst Thou have me do?"" is told, ""Go and seek Lambert, and he will instruct you.""

With a sweeping gesture and a look of concentration, the infant is shaking two bells, as if to be in concert with the angel doing the same thing on the left side of the picture. They are definitely looking at each other, and since they are the only two doing this, the action has special significance: it shows the ""conductor"" Jesus in the role of the universe's prime mover.

The question of inviting an Italian painter was complicated primarily by the political circumstances and by religious principles. Efforts were made, for example, to attract Guercino and Albani to the English court, but the former declined on the basis that England was officially a Protestant country and that the climate was too inclement, and negotiations with the latter came to nothing. Indeed, a similar situation pertained during the reign of Charles II when the only Italian artist at court was Guercino's nephew, Benedetto Gennari, an inferior painter who worked in England from 1674. Significantly, when Orazio Gentileschi came to England in 1626 his main employer seems to have been Charles I's wife, Henrietta Maria, the daughter of Marie de' Medici, who continued to profess her Catholic faith after her marriage in 1625. For the queen Gentileschi painted the ceiling of the Great Hall in The Queen's House at Greenwich - Allegory of Peace and the Arts under the English Crown (now in Marlborough House, London) - and other important pictures by him are recorded at Greenwich such as The Finding of Moses (given by Charles I to Philip IV of Spain in 1633) and Joseph and Potiphar's Wife.

To the right and left of the arch, the angel and Mary kneel in their respective buildings. It is only through the connecting architecture that tension is maintained within the depiction of the Annunciation, even over this great, daring distance and separation of figures, and that God the Father  at the top of the triumphal arch  is also included in the action.

The predella was the territory of the contingent, of dramatic action unfolding in time, in the city street or across the landscape. Its scale was inherently humble, intimate; it became the natural location for that civic and vernacular imagery most characteristic of Sienese tradition. Giovanni di Paolo's main altarpieces nearly always present a Madonna in 'sacred conversation' with her attendant saints, offering very little opportunity for spatial and compositional play; after 1450, when the Florentine unbroken rectangular format became a dominant convention, they are seldom of much interest. His gifts are released, almost exclusively, in the predella. Giovanni di Paolo painted at least a hundred of these small narrative panels.

The new project was a scheme of fresco paintings to embellish the interior of a meeting room belonging to one of the city's oldest confraternities - the Confraternity of Santa Maria degli Angeli della Veste Nera (Saint Mary of the Angels and of the Black Robes). Founded in honour of the Virgin after 1450 the confraternity also adopted Bernardino as one of their saints, adding his name to the confraternity's title. For this reason the room that painters decorated is now known as the Oratory of San Bernardino. Designed as a place where the members of the confraternity would meet to conduct both their collective devotions and their administrative business, the Oratory of San Bernardino offers a rare example of an early sixteenth-century decorative ensemble that has survived in almost its original form.",1501-1550,"Fresco, 295 x 317 cm"

The altar represents a compound, iconographically unusual subject, the Assumption and Coronation of the Virgin. The work is made up of two parts, painted on different occasions and then joined together. The most likely hypothesis is that the upper panel with the Coronation of the Virgin (after a sketch by Raphael) is the work of Giulio Romano, while for the lower part with the Apostles gathered around a tomb covered in flowers an altarpiece by Giovan Francesco Penni was used.",1501-1550,"Oil on wood, 354 x 232 cm"

The structure of the composition was highly original. The figures are arranged along the sides of an invisible lozenge, leaving the centre of the painting empty. The use of light and shade emphasized both the very delicate colours (right through to the candid white robes of the brother on the right) and the deeply dark areas.

With the death of the pope in 1623 he returned to Cento, where he pursued a successful career providing easel paintings to clients throughout Europe.

In fact the two St Johns assume a different significance in each picture: the figure of Botticelli makes a move toward the Madonna holding her Child who raises his hand in blessing - as if acting as an intermediary between the Virgin and the spectator. Here, on the other hand, he points toward a desiccated tree trunk with the sinister prophecy: ""For now the axe is laid to the root of the trees.""

She is the embodiment of French academic classicism and could serve in comparable guise in many other pictures of the period. What she gestures towards, however, is dramatic in a different idiom: the stark moment of Lazarus's return from the dead, with him awakening in the deep cavernous gloom of his burial-chamber, lit only by a single torch, and experiencing hardly less violent and painful astonishment than do the figures gaping around him.",1651-1700,"Oil on canvas, 388 x 664 cm"

The theme became popular in the 16th century and remained so after the Counter-Reformation in spite of some disapproval by the Church because of its apocryphal character.

Leicher, who worked in Vienna, was a pupil and protegé of the Piarists. He worked a lot for them, and made several altarpieces with the representation of St. Joseph of Calasance (1556-1648), the founder of the order. who was canonized in 1767. These pictures mainly refer to the educational activity of the order, and show the saint in a circle of pupils, as he recommends them to the patronage of Mary and the little Jesus who are appearing among the clouds. The theme is the same with this devout Tata painting: the boys, who wear the fashionable clothes of the time, are accompanied by St. Joseph and their guarding angel. The lighting of the picture which draws the spectator's look upwards, the  expressive gestures, and the sweet, mild faces call to mind the art of Leicher's master, Franz Anton Maulbertsch. The Tata picture is one of the most harmonious works of Leicher in Hungary. He repeated this theme, with larger dimension and a changed composition, in Breznó's Piarist church (today Parish church) as well as in the altarpieces of the Nikolsburg (Mikoluv), Beneschau (Bensov u Prahy) and Nagykároly (Carei) Piarist churches.

The centre of the wall is dominated by the huge figure of Christ as the Vine, a literal representation of Christ's words in John 15:5: ""I am the vine, ye are the branches."" The figure of Christ, with the praying figures of Battista Suardi, his wife, and sister at his feet is presented as the trunk of the vine, and the branches sprout out of his upturned fingers. The branches then curl into circles, forming natural counterparts to the roundels on the south and west walls, and likewise containing half-length figures, this time of saints. Sprouting leaves and bunches of grapes, the branches extend into the gable of the west wall and across the ceiling to form a fictive bower, filled with clambering putti. At either side of the composition are ladders placed against the branches of the vine, and two groups of early Christian heretics, duly labeled with their names, are attempting to climb to join the Elect. But two of the church fathers, Jerome and Ambrose, resist their advance and send them tumbling down beyond the confines of the fresco into an unseen pit of perdition.",1501-1550,Fresco

Beside them and further back are two medical saints, Cosma and Damian, one of whom is holding a spatula and the other a pharmaceutical jar. The presence of these is due to the dedication of the altar, but there may also have been a personal meaning for Lotto. He was recovering from an illness between August and December 1546 when working on the altarpiece. Signs of this may perhaps also be found in the painting itself, with its simplification and poverty of inspiration, favouring the mystical moment typical of popular piety.

It may be that the development was precipitated by the fact that there was not much work to go round and it had to be shared among different painters. But it seems more likely that the reverse was the case and that too much was being demanded of fewer specialist craftworkers. This large altarpiece signed on its lower edge by both Niccolò di Ser Sozzo and Luca di Tommè in 1362 provides a striking example of such collaboration. Now divested of its original piers, pinnacle panels and predella, the altarpiece was painted probably for the high altar of San Tommaso, a church under the care of the religious order known as the Humiliati. Accordingly, the apostle Thomas is portrayed on the Virgin's right-hand side, a position conventionally understood as that of greatest honour. To his right appears Saint John the Baptist, while Saints Benedict and Stephen appear to the left of the Virgin.

But in contrast to St Jerome pictures by Bellini and by other Venetian painters such as Cima and Lotto, Mansueti packs his composition with an enormous amount of further detail: a bear, a stoat, a dog, a deer, a rabbit, two monkeys, and two leopards in the foreground; a shepherd with sheep and cows in the right middleground; a river with gondoliers, washerwomen, swans and ducks, also in the middleground; and winding roads, with a man and his donkey, and other men walking and riding, leading the eye to a church, a castle, and distant mountains in the background. The overall effect is cluttered. Nevertheless, in part because of the very naivety of the expression, the picture communicates a sense of delight in an orderly, domesticated world, where God's creatures, human and animal, coexist in peace and harmony.",1501-1550,"Oil on panel, 68 x 90 cm"

In a romantic dream of the rediscovery of a classical measure, the world of Andrea Mantegna assumes a form in almost metaphysical terms where images stand out with solid plasticity in a space which has been rigorously marked out according to the extremely precise rules of perspective. This severe formal abstraction softens a little as far as the colour is concerned after Mantegna's visit to Venice to meet the Bellinis, whose sister Nicolosia the artist had married. The 'St. George' of the Accademia Galleries dates from a period later than the visit to Venice but before Andrea Mantegna left Padua forever in 1460 for the court of the Marquis Ludovico Gonzaga at Mantova.",1451-1500,"Tempera on panel, 66 x 32 cm"

Masip subsequently assimilated the style of these more advanced artists. In his art, Masip embodied four distinct stages of Italian painting, beginning with the Emilia-Paduan style of the later Quattrocento and passing through Leonardo and early Sebastiano del Piombo to Raphael.

All manner of artists flocked into the town on the Scheldt. One of these was Quentin Massys from Louvain, who registered as a painter in the St. Lucas Guild in 1491, and is regarded as the founder of the Antwerp School which was soon to topple the hegemony of the School of Bruges. He remained faithful to the Flemish tradition, although the sfumato in the background of some of his landscapes shows that he was familiar with the work of Leonardo da Vinci. He is usually regarded as a painter of monumental works, and rightly so, but he also painted smaller scale scenes with figures. This is hardly surprising, since his technique had its sources in miniature paintings.

These maidens were educated and received moral instruction from the priests, an arrangement which to some extent foreshadowed the orders of nuns in the Middle Ages.

We are invited to marvel at the humility of Mary, a modest - if surprisingly well-to-do - townswoman; at her maternal devotion - she does not rely on a nursemaid to care for her child; and at the tender affection between her and her son. More profoundly, we are led to reflect on the Incarnation: Christ has truly become man, touching his genitals like like any baby boy. His mother is without doubt the Virgin, for she wears her hair loose like an unmarried girl or a queen at her coronation. Haloes radiate from both their heads.

Peter of Luxembourg, according to early sources, died at the age of eighteen, by which age he was already a cardinal. He had subjected himself to every type of mediaeval self torture and ascetic mortification of the flesh: ""Ascetic, horribly dirty and covered with vermin, amidst the unbridled luxury of the courts of Berry and Burgundy, and incessantly confessing to sins he had probably not committed."" Such is the picture his contemporary Froissart gives of him in his chronicle, but in this painting produced, some sixty years after his death (1387), the grim mortification of the ascetic has been modified to the figure of an idealized young saint, now the object of a religious cult. In Huizinga's words ""a striking representative of the type of 'under-witted' saint"", he had been transformed into a saint in the course of the years immediately following his death, and the Avignon master was more influenced by his later reputation than by the reality of his life.",1451-1500,"Panel, 78 x 58 cm"

Friedländer attributed the Scenes from the Life of St Ursula, today in the Groeninge Museum, Bruges, to a painter he called the Master of the Legend of St Ursula. He saw this artist as a particularly talented disciple of Hans Memling and Rogier van der Weyden. In 1921 it was proposed that this anonymous artist was one Pieter Casembroot, a painter from Bruges who had apprenticed to Arnout de Mol, before becoming a master himself in 1459, none of whose works had hitherto been identified. Today, this hypothesis is widely accepted. Casembroot's most productive years were those between 1480 and 1500.

The position of the Child in his mother's hands is somewhat reminiscent in type of Hugo van der Goes' little painting of the Virgin in Frankfurt (Städelsches Kunstinstitut). The origins of this type are to be found in the Flémalle circle, which means that Memling might also have been inspired by a composition of that master. We find the same tile pattern in Van der Weyden's Annunciation in the Louvre, and in the Presentation in the Temple (Washington, National Gallery of Art) by a follower of Van der Weyden, now known as the Master of the Prado Adoration. By contrast, the arcade opening onto the landscape, which lends horizontal rhythm to the composition, is a pure Memling invention. An interesting detail in the landscape is the church on the right, which could be the abbey church of Seligenstadt, Memling's birthplace. The architectural significance of the second row of small columns of a different type, which stands behind the parapet and supports a beam, is less plain.

He was raised to the rank of cardinal, and given a faithful companion in the shape of a lion, from whose paw he was said to have removed a thorn. During his life as a hermit in the Syrian desert, Jerome sought to banish his sinful thoughts by chastising himself. The motif of the saint beating his chest with a stone was probably inspired by Italian examples, although no clear prototype springs to mind. Nevertheless, this still appears to be the first Netherlandish work to present on such a monumental scale a subject that was to become one of art's iconographical mainstays from the sixteenth century onwards. Interestingly, several similar paintings, possibly influenced by Memling, were produced in Bruges around this period and immediately afterwards. The saint kneels before a crucifix, bearded and bald, with the dark brown robe of the penitent about his naked body. His figure is tall and slim, and almost fills the foreground of the painting.

Nevertheless, it is an interesting little work which corresponds fully with Memling's style and spatial approach. The composition derives from Rogier van der Weyden. It portrays the episode in which Jerome removes the thorn from the lion's paw. The architectural setting is a characteristic Memling invention. The scene is viewed through a heavy round arch in brown stone, positioned at an angle close to the picture plane. It is related to the more modest little arches in the wings containing the Allegory of True Love. The fairly heavily dotted little trees in the background also recall that work.",1451-1500,"Oil on oak panel, 37 x 24,5 cm"

It is based on an invention of Rogier van der Weyden. The composition itself is most closely related to the Virgin Enthroned in Berlin, which also takes place in a room with two windows and a stone throne with volute armrests. The throne in St Osyth is not, however, white but amber coloured and is profusely decorated with tracery, foliage and trails, and little sculptures in white stone. The sculpture that tops the throne represents the archangel expelling Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. The link with the Incarnation as the work's principal theme is clear. Recent cleaning showed the painting to be less damaged than had initially been feared, and uncovered the uppermost part of the house that can be made out hazily through the stained glass of the right window.

The example closest in style to Flémalle, which might be a fairly faithful copy of the prototype, is a version facing to the right in Philadelphia.

The two lateral sides each feature three scenes from the life of St Ursula, while the two narrower ends show the saints and the 11,000 virgins, the Virgin and Child and the donors. The decoration of the shrine occupies a central position in Hans Memling's wide-ranging oeuvre and demonstrates both his outstanding qualities and his limitations as an artist. His energies are devoted above all to the portrayal of single figures in graceful poses, to the realistic observation of detail, and to an exquisite palette which is often reminiscent of miniature painting. Although Memling is a narrator, dramatic climax is foreign to his temperament even in a scene of martyrdom. He lacks depth of expression and the ability to convincingly ""stage-manage"" crowd scenes. Instead, he provides a wealth of inexhaustibly varied details which together ""add up"" into the overall composition. A comparison with Carpaccio's more or less contemporaneous treatment of the St Ursula legend is particularly illuminating.",1451-1500,"Gilded and painted wood, 87 x 33 x 91 cm"

They were cut down to matching size obviously before 1656. The Virgin, who is clearly standing up as she reaches the height of the column capitals and does not have the Child on her lap, has been cut in half. The donors, who are kneeling, have been trimmed at the top and bottom to more or less the same height. It is extremely difficult after so much time to determine why the painting was mutilated in this way. The darker colour to the man's right, and above all the red drapery to the woman's left, seem to be original, at least in part and are thus likely to be remnants of the patron saints who originally stood alongside the donors . The hypothesis that the three paintings originally belonged to a single fixed panel is strengthened by the half dowel-holes that are still to be seen on the inner edges of the portraits. The three panels are thus fragments of the original vertical planks of the painting, which were linked by internal dowel pegs. We ought, therefore, to imagine a composition similar to the Virgin with donor in Ottawa, but with an extra figure on the opposite side.

Here however, creeping into view from behind, we see St John making direct eye contact with us, cheekily imploring us to remain quiet for fear of awakening his young cousin who sleeps cradled against his mother's bosom.

The painting may be viewed as a symbol of the tireless search for subtleties and depth of feeling that marked the Counter-Reformation spirit of seventeenth-century Lombard painting. Having abandoned the profane elegance of the preceding period, it strains for a programmed mortification of the senses. The corrupt and corruptible body is the principal subject, and tears and sorrow prevail. Intended to show a forthright, almost brutal realism, this St Francis achieves the opposite effect. From its insistent ""reality"" there emerges an absolute abstraction, an entirely expressionistic unreality.

The drawing is always perceptibly subtle and light, the colours do not glow with varnish, but enchant with their unlacquered, milky opaque effect. This painter, stemming from a distinguished patrician family, seems to have wanted throughout his life to express the nobility of the human face and the elegance of gestures and attitudes in his paintings. He did not make use of many innovations of the first half of the 15th century, and in fact one has the impression as if Neroccio, forgetting about his direct artistic antecedents, had intended to reach back to traditions of the previous century. And yet in fact he knew and employed the devices of perspective and used light and shadow in the modelling of his figures, but he was less interested in these. Neroccio had no wish to deny the two-dimensional quality of the surface he painted, and the application of foreshortening and the adding of depth to his composition concerned him only as long and inasmuch as they contributed to the harmonious effect of the composition as a whole. In the light that brushed the faces and hands he did not look for a method to achieve plastic unity and compactness, but rather for a means to expose as much of the beauties of detail as possible and to make the pictorial surface as rich as possible.",1451-1500,"Tempera on wood, 73 x 50 cm"

It may be that the development was precipitated by the fact that there was not much work to go round and it had to be shared among different painters. But it seems more likely that the reverse was the case and that too much was being demanded of fewer specialist craftworkers. This large altarpiece signed on its lower edge by both Niccolò di Ser Sozzo and Luca di Tommè in 1362 provides a striking example of such collaboration. Now divested of its original piers, pinnacle panels and predella, the altarpiece was painted probably for the high altar of San Tommaso, a church under the care of the religious order known as the Humiliati. Accordingly, the apostle Thomas is portrayed on the Virgin's right-hand side, a position conventionally understood as that of greatest honour. To his right appears Saint John the Baptist, while Saints Benedict and Stephen appear to the left of the Virgin. The general consensus among art historians is that Niccolò di Ser Sozzo painted the Virgin and Christ Child, Saint Benedict and Saint Stephen while Luca di Tommè painted Saints John the Baptist and Thomas.",1351-1400,"Tempera on panel, 191 x 297 cm"

Like Quentin Massys, with whom he worked occasionally, he lived and worked in Antwerp. His contribution to the development of a new genre, the independent landscape painting, was considerable. In his religious paintings, he placed his figures against a background of immense vistas presented as a bird's eye view of a host of cosmic elements: mountains and crags, sweeping valleys, rivers and meadows, towns and villages - one after the other they draw the eye of the beholder on to a distant horizon. Although these are not yet fully independent landscape paintings, the landscape is the most important element in his compositions. The human figures play only a secondary role, as can be seen in St Christopher bearing the Christ Child, a very popular subject at that time and on into the 17th century, because St. Christopher was believed to give protection against sudden death. There can be no doubt that Pieter Bruegel studied Patenier's landscapes before leaving for Italy and painting the Alps.",1501-1550,"Oil on panel, 48 x 59,5 cm"

Like many painters of the period, he uses landscape to create a suitable setting for the figures in his scenes. But although he integrates his narrative within them, his landscapes become more than mere backgrounds, and begin to assume their own autonomy. For the most part, Patenier maintains an equilibrium within his paintings between the presence of the figures and the landscape, and only in a few is he bold enough to shift this balance in favour of his vision of nature. His detailed technique is typical of Flemish artists, but his novelty lies in his creation of space and depth through subtle gradations of light and colour, as well as a certain effort at capturing the atmosphere of the scene.",1501-1550,"Oil on panel, 121 x 177 cm"

To him he owed his loose manner of painting; an earthy, warm palette competing with whites, and a chiaroscuro used to create an atmosphere rather than the pathos which had been produced until recently by Johann Liss and Johann Carl Loth. When he left Crespi and returned to Venice in 1711, his art presented a complete contrast to the prevailing Venetian style as represented by Ricci, Pellegrini and Amigoni. It was not until the 1720s that Piazzetta used lighter tones. His scenes from the Old and New Testaments were painted in the genre style, and have an almost tactile closeness.

The view Raphael has chosen more or less matches the view he had of Rome in 1520 from his Vatican loggie, which are located right behind the wall painted with the fresco. The Citadel of Sant'Angelo appears to be Raphael's reconstruction of the original ancient building, the erstwhile Hadrian Mausoleum, as it might have looked in the days of Emperor Constantine. By depicting this view of ancient Rome, Raphael is suggesting to anyone viewing that fresco that Constantine experienced his vision in the precise place where the Vatican State is now located.

In the background Joseph works away, unconcerned, at his carpentry. Mary, meanwhile, with a book in her hand, looks up from her reading and turns towards the Child, raising the cover that shields him from the firelight, to gaze at him or perhaps just to make sure he is all right. The tenderness of the young mother's movement accords with the deep, warm colours, among which the cherry-red of her skirt is the strongest accent.",1601-1650,Oil on canvas

It is not known whether Ribalta was aquainted with the work of Caravaggio or whether he arrived independently at results parallel to those achieved by the Italian Tenebrists. At all events, his style is remarkable for its virile naturalism. The brushwork is increasingly bold and free, so different from the polished smoothness of the previous age. Ribalta sought expressiveness as well as beauty and accentuated the sculptural modeling of his forms by contrasting light and shade. Among his better known works are the Last Supper in the Valencia Museum and the panels of the great altarpiece of Algemesi, painted in 1603; one of these, that depicting the martyrdom of St James, suggests a connection between Ribalta and Navarrete.",1601-1650,"Oil on canvas, 158 x 113 cm"

In Madrid, Ribalta experienced the Florentine naturalism of the Carducho brothers. (It is also possible that Pedro Orrente played a part in directing Ribalta toward a greater naturalism.) Indeed, his St Francis Comforted by a Musical Angel, painted around 1620 for an altar in the church of the Capuchinos of Valencia, is a direct descendant of Bartolome Carducho's Death of St Francis. This painting is purged of all vestiges of mannerism and uses the powerful force of light to enhance the presence of figures and objects alike.

His work has often been mistaken for that of a follower of Raphael, so closely did he model himself on the 'pure' style of an earlier age. After he had copied some pictures for the Benedictine monastery in Perugia at the age of 21, he was introduced to a reformed Franciscan friary in Rome, the city in which he lived for some forty years and where he died.

In the St Matthew and the Angel, a subject appropriate for the Milanese mint insofar as the saint was a tax collector, an angel appears in the darkness to inspire the seated evangelist. Strangely distorting light and shadows play across their drapery and faces, the result of illumination from a small oil lamp placed like a footlight on the table below and in front of them. In the dark recesses at the right two men attend to a seated figure, probably St Matthew in the house of the Queen of Ethopia's eunuch after he had preached and discredited some local magicians. vFlames and sparks from the fireplace throw the three figures into relief, catching St Matthew's hands and face with their light, but consigning the rest of his body to near total darkness. At the far left four small figures wander along a moonlit street.

When the Duke later left Tuscany, Count Filippo stayed behind as a royal deputy; his task was to keep under control the animosity of the Ghibelline forces, led by the very bellicose Castruccio Castracani. It seems quite likely that during his stay in Siena the Lord of Altomonte met the artist who had given such a masterly portrayal of the Anjou of Naples and of Hungary on the walls of the Lower Church in Assisi and in the Naples Altarpiece commissioned by King Robert. So he presumably seized this opportunity to commission a small painting himself, probably a diptych; the little panel showing St Ladislaus, King of Hungary, now in the Museo della Consolazione in Altomonte, was probably part of that diptych.",1301-1350,"Tempera on wood, 45,5 x 21,5 cm"

The position of the figure and the size of the panel, whose format has not suffered any alterations in the course of time, show that the work was originally part of a set composed by other elements. Apart from the present panel, it included on the left the figure of St Ansano, the protector of the city of Siena, at the centre the Virgin with Child and on the right the figures of St Andrew and of St Luke. The five panels composed a polyptych of a rather unusual shape, with the central panel of the same size as the side panels, and with each element independently framed. The box frames enclosing the various painted panels are in fact original, although their authenticity has often been questioned due perhaps to the restorations they have undergone. Each panel also had the name of the saint represented inscribed on the gilded background, as can still be seen in the St Luke from the Getty Collection; this piece also has the back painted in marble imitation, which may suggest that originally the polyptych was meant to be transported.",1301-1350,"Tempera and gold on panel, 58 x 39 cm"

He also identified the saint as the apostle Andrew, as had Weigelt (1929), and this identification has been borne out by the traces of the apostles name that was once painted on the gold background to either side of the saints head (the traces are clearly visible in the image appearing on the website). Further, Boskovits suggested that these five panels formed an altarpiece commissioned from Simone in 1326 for the Palazzo Pubblico and that was mentioned rather generically by Ghiberti in his Commentaries: ""and in the said palace a very good altarpiece."" The five panels in question are, left to right: Saint Ansanus (Robert Lehman Collection, MMA, 1975.1.13), Saint Peter (Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid), Madonna and Child (Robert Lehman Collection, MMA, 1975.1.12), Saint Andrew, and Saint Luke (J.

The work 'St Jerome and St Andrew' is a major example of these tendencies.

The incisive force of the line combines with rich and luminous colour to create the firmly modelled figures. The self-conscious statement of dramatic style became another pretext for the continuing polemic between Tintoretto and Titian. Dolce clearly alludes to it when, in his 'Dialogo della pittura' of 1558, he criticizes the unfortunate position of the princess, whom he takes to be St. Margaret, astride the dragon.",1551-1600,"Oil on canvas, 226 x 146 cm"

It was probably commissioned as a private altarpiece, and the conventional arched vertical format had never before, and has rarely since, been used to such dynamic and disturbing effect. The imagery also is unusual. The story of St George of Cappadocia, Roman officer and Christian martyr, was made popular in Western Europe through The Golden Legend, a calendar-book of tales of the lives of the saints compiled in the late thirteenth century. It is there that we find the story of a dragon terrorising the countryside demanding human sacrifice. When the fatal lot fell to Cleodolinda, the daughter of the king, St George, riding by on his charger, turned to help her and vanquished the dragon 'in the name of Christ'. In a departure from tradition, Tintoretto has shown the livid cadaver of a previous victim in the pose of the crucified Christ and included God the Father in the heavens blessing the victory of good over evil. The terrified princess, fleeing uphill from the dragon climbing out of the sea, nearly stumbles out of the foreground. St George has galloped into the painting from our right, the direction of a hidden source of light which picks out the trunks of the trees, the rump of the horse, the armour of the knight and the flesh and garments of Cleodolinda.",1551-1600,"Oil on canvas, 158 x 100 cm"

The monumental stairway indicates the musical connection; its 15 steps or ""grades"" refer to the 15 graduals, the psalms sung by pilgrims in annual temple processions. The singers' gallery above the organ was also painted by Tintoretto. The dark carving of the breastwork and the frames of the wings were partly gilded, like the stairway in the painting; Tintoretto picked out its undulating ornamentation in gold leaf. This ""Byzantine"" stylistic element is particularly effective in the shadowy area on the left, where it produces a sense of mystic illumination. The richly decorated steps on Mary's way into the temple are reminiscent of the Scala dei Giganti in the interior courtyard of the Ducal Palace, the lower section of which, like the stairway up to the temple, has 15 steps.

The two angels at the top, at least, were probably painted from the same three-dimensional model. Tintoretto intentionally places the golden key of heaven between St Peters thighs. Contemporary comedies leave us in no doubt about the erotic symbolism of the key. It was also the subject of the satirical piece La chiave (The Key) by Tintoretto's friend Anton Francesco Doni.

He modified his style and technique according to the commission. He sometimes deliberately imitated the style of other painters, but his ideal was said to be 'the drawing of Michelangelo and the colouring of Titian'.

On the other hand, the manner of painting and the arrangement of the figures filling the space without overcrowding it, link the panel to a later period. This inconsistency serves to enhance the solemnity of the meeting between the saintly women and their queen. Barbara, seen holding a tower in the lower left corner, Catherine sitting above her with a broken wheel in her lap and, on the other side of the Virgin, St. Dorothy with a basket of flowers, and Margaret leading a dragon on a leash like a dog, are the noblest of the martyr virgins. St. Catherine having been regarded as the highest ranking among them, it is on her finger that the Infant Jesus slips the engagement with a play boyish gesture. This unstressed yet very important detail illustrates an episode from a characteristically medieval legend that probably owed its birth to a misunderstanding. It is thought that Catherine's original attribute, the wheel, as represented in a small picture, was mistaken for engagement ring symbolizing devotion to the Saviour.

His earliest pictures are the closest to those of Caravaggio, but his art lacked almost all Caravaggio's sense of drama. Instead, he concentrated on flashy and facile effects, which were, of course, to stand him in good stead at the court of Louis XIII, where he was to become the first French painter to be able to understand and interpret the Italian Baroque. He was good at lighting effects and sharp contrasts of colour. An example of this is the St Jerome and the Angel. This painting is devoid of the drama which marks Caravaggio's St Matthew and the Angel, Vouet relied much more on his technique of strong lighting and bold brushwork, and was never interested in penetrating the essence of his subject-matter.",1601-1650,"Oil on canvas, 145 x 180 cm"

The excellent painting faintly reveals Christ's evanescent face, depicted in brownish-grey tonalities that form a contrast with the intense white of the cloth and the shadows produced by the folds.

After living in Venice and Rome, where he absorbed the late Mannerist style, the Greek-born artist settled in the Spanish city of Toledo in 1577 to work on the high altar of the convent church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo. The church of this ancient Cistercian convent was being rebuilt as the funerary chapel of a pious widow, Doña Maria de Silva. In El Greco’s grand design, the Assumption was surmounted by a representation of the Trinity and was ﬂanked by two side altars decorated with paintings of the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Resurrection. The visionary imagery of the Assumption and the Trinity aptly expressed the patron’s hope of salvation. Here the Virgin ﬂoats upward, supported on the crescent moon that is symbolic of her purity, while the boldly modeled heads of the crowd of apostles gathered around her empty tomb express amazement and concern.

Removed from the great centers of Renaissance art, he was able to create a remarkably innovative body of work. This intimate devotional panel is a product of the artist’s youth. Here Correggio revealed his own evolving style while assimilating lessons from other masters. The panel’s pyramidal grouping of figures reﬂects the High Renaissance manner of Raphael, while their soft outlines and the Virgin’s enigmatic smile recall Leonardo da Vinci. The evocative use of the distant landscape demonstrates the young artist’s awareness of Northern European precedents. The gentle sensuousness of the figures and the tenderness they show one another through glance are unique to Correggio. The artist used light, shadow, and color to bathe the panel in a gentle glow; skin and fabrics appear to take on a velvety texture.

Depicted here is the most frequently represented episode from the popular legend of Saint George, in which the model Christian knight saves a town and rescues a beautiful princess. Conceived in the elegant, decorative International Gothic style, the painting was originally the center of an altarpiece dedicated to Saint George that was apparently made for the chapel of the palace of the Catalan government in Barcelona. This central scene was surrounded by four smaller narrative panels, now in the Musée du Louvre, Paris, and was probably surmounted by a lost image of Christ on the Cross. Here Saint George, on his white steed, triumphs over the evil dragon. A wealth of precisely observed details intensifies the drama. Dressed in an ermine-lined robe, the princess wears a sumptuous gilt crown atop her wavy red-gold hair. Her parents and their subjects watch the spectacle from the distant town walls. George’s halo and armor and the scaly body of the dragon are richly modeled with raised stucco decoration.

Below, the crowned figure of King David holds an inscribed scroll. More often in Crucifixion scenes of this period, a pelican appears at the top of the cross and the skull of Adam lies at the foot. A penitential theme is suggested by the figures kneeling under the Cross: on the right is a haloed Magdalen in a red robe; on the left, a man with the incised rays of a beatus, or blessed one, emanating from his head wears the torn brown cloak of a hermit.

His art has long been considered the embodiment of the ideals of seventeenth-century classicism. In this painting, Saint John, one of the four Evangelists who wrote the Gospels of the New Testament, reclines beside his attribute, the eagle. He is here depicted as a powerful old man, presumably after retiring to the Greek island of Patmos to write his gospel and the book of Revelation at the end of his life. To suggest the vanished glory of the ancient world, Poussin carefully constructed an idealized setting for the saint, complete with an obelisk, a temple, and column fragments. Man-made and natural forms were adjusted according to principles of geometry and logic to convey the measured order of the scene. Even the profile view of Saint John is in harmony with the classical landscape.

Saint Francis swoons in ecstasy into the arms of an angel after meditating on the instruments used to torture Jesus, presented by another angel on the left.

This panel was almost certainly once part of the major altarpiece that he painted shortly after 1440 for the high altar of the church of the Dominican convent of San Marco in Florence, a work commissioned by Cosimo de’ Medici. Dismantled by the early 19th century, Fra Angelico’s altarpiece had as its focal point a large central panel representing the Virgin and Child with saints; below this a predella featured episodes from the lives of the Medici patrons, Saints Cosmas (Cosimo’s namesake) and Damian. At the sides, set into the uprights of the frame, were 10 separate saints standing on clouds. Saint Anthony Abbot would have been one of these; a fourth-century Egyptian hermit, the saint was considered the founder of monasticism.", 1440–1441,Tempera on panel

The first painting depicts John twice, leaving civilization—marked by ornate buildings and manicured agricultural fields—and entering the wilderness to become a hermit.

These panels are the wings of a triptych, a three-paneled folding altarpiece, whose center (now in the Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels) shows the Virgin and Child enthroned under an elaborate architectural canopy.  The two elegant saints are identifiable by their attributes: for Catherine, the wheel upon which she was tortured and the sword with which she was martyred; and for Barbara, the tower where her father locked her up to keep her safe from suitors. Saint Catherine also holds a ring, which the Christ Child in the Brussels panel reaches to grasp, thus indicating that their mystical union was the subject of the triptych.  The tops of the two wings have been rounded off to mask their original function as moveable shutters to the left and right of the center panel.

Van der Weyden was well known for his exquisite devotional diptychs, and Memling was influenced by his work, though he made his paired paintings more realistic by setting the figures in a measurable domestic space. This portrait of the unidentified patron and the image of the Virgin and Child were separated many years ago; they were reunited at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1953. Unfortunately, Portrait of a Man in Prayer is in very poor condition; much better preserved is the image Saint Anthony of Padua, presumably the sitter’s patron saint, on the reverse of the portrait.  The saint was painted in subdued tones of gray, in imitation of stone, a convention often used on the backs of Netherlandish altarpieces.  Anthony of Padua, an important early follower of Saint Francis, was more popular in Italy, Spain and Portugal than in the Low Countries, hence the diptych may have been made for a member of the large foreign community in Bruges.", 1480–1490,Oil on panel

In the image represented, as well as its medium, technique and style, the drawing relates to Raphael’s most important commissions from this period; the Transfiguration altarpiece, now in the Pinacoteca Vaticana (Dussler 1971, pp. 52-55, pl. 111), which he completed shortly before his death on April 6, 1520; and the decoration of the walls of the Sala di Costantino, the largest of the papal suite of rooms in the Vatican (Dussler, pp. 86-88, pls. 143-44; Quednau 1979).  With the possible exception of two allegorical figures in oil, this project, which was underway by late 1519, was largely executed by Raphael’s assistants under the direction of Giulio Romano, and completed in 1524.  Although the Sala’s general decorative scheme was devised by Raphel, there are still questions concerning the extent of his responsibility for the design of individual components (Oberhuber/Fischel 1972, pp. 184-204).", 1518–1520,"Black chalk, heightened with white chalk and lead white, partially oxidized, over stylus underdrawing, on cream laid paper"

Dwarfed by the giant saint and his heavy burden, miniscule figures appear in the water, barely discernable at first glance.

The composition tells an apocryphal legend of Saint John Chrysostom, in which the saint, living as a hermit, seduces and impregnates the daughter of an emperor. Shocked by his own actions, John throws the princess from a cliff and vows never to rise from the ground in penance for his misdeeds. After the princess and her child are miraculously discovered still alive, John’s sins are forgiven. In Campagnola’s composition, the princess and child are presented in the foreground while John is depicted walking on all fours in the background.

In the final state the artist added stars, as well as more definition to the clouds and landscape, and intensified the highlights of the figures and their respective objects (the staff of the Saint, and the world held by the Christ-child).

The painter's penchant for original and descriptive narrative detail appears in the treatment of the desert landscape and its fauna (symbols of the saint's temptations) beneath the luminous sky at dusk. A pot of gold in the lower left corner (which has been scraped away) symbolized the seductive worldly goods that the stalwart saint resists. The series of eight panels were likely arranged vertically, surrounding a central painted or sculpted image of Saint Anthony. The complex was probably commissioned for a member of the Sienese Martinozzi family (whose arms appear on one of the panels) for an Augustinian foundation, either in Siena or perhaps in the Marches region, where several branches of this family were located. This panel is the sixth in a series of eight that includes Saint Anthony at Mass (Gemäldegalerie, SMPK, Berlin); Saint Anthony Distributing His Wealth and Saint Anthony Blessed by an Old Hermit (both National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.); Saint Anthony Tempted by the Devil in the Guise of a Woman and Saint Anthony Beaten by Devils (both Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven); and Journey and Meeting of Saint Anthony with Saint Paul the Hermit and Funeral of Saint Anthony (both National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.).The enigmatic Osservanza Master has variously been identified as Sassetta and also as the young Sano di Pietro, based on close stylistic affinities with these other Sienese artists. It is also possible that the paintings attributed to the Osservanza Master, including the altarpiece from which this panel originated, are the product of a collaborative workshop to which these artists belonged.",,Tempera and gold on wood

Although executed on parchment, this work was not part of a manuscript but conceived as an independent devotional object. It is essentially a reduced version of the painted altarpieces produced by the artist for the principal churches in Verona and the surrounding region. In the background, a white-clad Olivetan monk is led to a walled complex by Saint Cecilia, wearing a green mantle, who is also shown standing in the position of honor to the Virgin’s right, wearing a crown of roses. The image may have been produced for a wealthy patron or a canon of the monastic school dedicated to the Virgin and Saint Cecilia that was attached to the important Olivetan Monastery of Santa Maria in Organo in Verona, for which Francesco executed several commissions.",,Tempera on parchment; Underdrawing in sepia ink

Two additional panels portraying standing male figures in the Lehman Collection (1975.1.55, 1975.1.56), also belonged to the same complex, which may have been commissioned by the guild of the Pizzicaiuoli (purveyors of dry goods) in 1447 for their new chapel in the church of the hospital of Santa Maria della Scala in Siena.Additional panels that are conjecturally associated with the Pizzicaiuoli altarpiece are: the Purification of the Virgin (Pinacoteca Nazionale, Siena), Saint Catherine Invested with the Dominican Habit (Cleveland Museum of Art), Saint Catherine and the Beggar (Cleveland Museum of Art), Saint Catherine Dictating Her Dialogues to Raymond of Capua (Detroit Institute of Arts), Saint Catherine before a Pope (Thyssen-Bornemisza Foundation), Death of Saint Catherine (private collection), Crucifixion (Rijksmuseum Het Catharijneconvent, Utrecht, on deposit at the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), and pilaster figures representing Saint Galganus and Blessed Peter of Siena(?)

Gold snuffboxes and boxes decorated with portrait miniatures were prized and frequently given as royal gifts, often to ambassadors or members of the court in lieu of cash payments for their services. Coveted and admired, these boxes were produced from a variety of materials. The best were skillfully made of gold and embellished with diamonds, enameled decoration, lacquer, and other luxurious materials. By the middle of the century, the taking of snuff had become an entrenched social ritual, and the snuffbox, too, had become an important social prop. Snuffboxes were considered highly fashionable accessories, with some merchants advertising new boxes with each change of season.

Its provenance is unknown, and the tradition that it decorated a chapel in the church of San Miniato fra le Torri in Florence is probably wrong: that fresco was described by early writers as about twice the size and was attributed to the Pollaiuolo brothers. In true fresco technique, pigments mixed with water are applied directly on a fresh (or fresco) plaster wall. As the plaster sets, a chemical reaction occurs whereby the pigment particles become locked into the wall, giving the work great durability. In the fifteenth century, the design for a fresco was often executed with a red pigment, known as sinopia, on a preparatory layer of coarse plaster (""arriccio""). Over this was laid just the amount of finely ground plaster (""intonaco"") that could be painted in a single day. Our fresco comprises seven such sections, or ""giornate"", which closely follow the contours of the figures and drapery. The painting is in exceptionally good condition. Many details, especially in the landscape, were added after the plaster had dried. Such ""a secco"" details have usually fallen away.",,Fresco

The single-faced diptych’s carved wooden case could be opened to reveal paintings of the Virgin Mary and St. George, two of the most popular figures in Ethiopian Orthodoxy Christianity. The hollow inverted v-shaped cylinder at the top enabled it to be suspended from the owner's neck. An interlaced square cross is carved below the loop on each side. Two small c-shaped hooks are mounted on hinges on the right side of the front of the case. They likely fit into a now-missing latch, which would have been attached to two holes pierced through the reverse of the case. Both the front and back of the case are ornamented with shallow carved designs alternating with plain bands. The front of the case has four plain bands, and three patterned with interlace, hatching, and zigzags. A flared pattée cross is at its center. On the reverse of the case are three plain bands interspersed with two bands carved with interlace and hatching. They frame an inner cross composed of a diagonal three-band interlace enclosing a circle. The wood on the front and sides of the case have a slight sheen, and is darker than that of the back. On the principle side, the main panel features Mary and the Christ Child flanked by two archangels. She carries the Christ child on her right side, and holds a mappula (handkerchief) in her left hand. Her sweeping blue robe, edged with yellow and green, covers her hair. A small yellow halo surrounds each figure’s head. This form of the Virgin and Child was modeled after the Virgin of Santa Maria Maggiore, first introduced into Ethiopia in print form by the Jesuits around 1600. Rather than slavishly copying the European model, the Ethiopian artists adapted it to their own aesthetic preferences, as evident by the short, cropped black hair of Christ and the archangels. Instead of standing against a blank backdrop, as the Virgin does in the European model, the Virgin sits on a throne draped with bright yellow cloth enlivened with a red grid pattern. The addition of the throne, as well as the winged archangels—who each hold a hand cross particular to Ethiopian priests-- is itself drawn from Ethiopian models of the Virgin dating to the fourteenth century or earlier. The child’s striped robe, reminiscent of locally-produced woven textiles, and bare feet also represent a departure from the print. Believed to be an intercessor between humans and God, the Virgin Mary is one of the Ethiopian Orthodox church’s most venerated figures. Mary’s personal presence is felt through her divine images, thus making this a diminutive, yet powerful object.St. George slaying the dragon is represented on the adjacent panel. Like many Ethiopian saints, he is depicted on horseback; the distinctive white coat of his horse helps to identify him. The horse’s trappings are simple strips of red and green, ornamented only with yellow rings on the harness. Like the male figures in the adjoining panel, St. George has a halo and close-cropped black hair. His robe of green, blue, and red flies out behind his right arm, which he raises to point a long spear at a scale-covered dragon. The painting has captured the moment when the tip of the spear enters the dragon’s open mouth. Recoiling beneath the feet of the white steed, the dragon has a curling tail and a single eye, a hallmark in Ethiopian Orthodox painting of evil figures. Images of St. George the Dragon-Killer represent the triumph of good over evil, in which the warrior saint is a knight of Christ. To the saint’s right is Birutawit the Maiden, dressed in a long red robe. She is perched in a tree whose leaves are represented by irregular circles of green sprouting from slender brown branches. Iconography of the rescued maiden arose in Ethiopian icons of St. George in the fifteenth century. His pose, dress, and equipment evoke imagery of noble Ethiopian warriors, placing the story of the powerful saint in Ethiopia itself. Given the damage to the paint, it is difficult to determine the original state of the background, though it appears to have been a solid yellow field.Images of St. Mary and St. George were frequently juxtaposed in diptychs and other icon paintings because they were linked in the Senkessar, a religious text with the death dates of the saints and short commentaries on their lives. In the Senkessar, the Feast of the Assumption of both the Virgin and St. George take place on the same day (16 Nähase). As is typical in these pairings, St. George rides towards the Virgin in this diptych, emphasizing his role as Christian protector.Pendant icons became popular in the seventeenth century, and remained common until the nineteenth. The dating of this work is contested: it has been suggested that given the execution of the painting and its bright pigments, it is highly likely that a carved case of an earlier date and higher quality was repainted sometime in the twentieth century, using the historic Gondärine style. The Gondärine style evolved in the courtly scriptoria in the mid-seventeenth century, and remains a popular model for present-day painters of religious art. It is generally characterized by the use of three-quarter pose, vivid pigments, the inclusion of both secular and religious objects, and the detailed rendering of textiles. While the ""First Gondärine"" style tended towards flatter depictions, the ""Second Gondärine"" incorporated more naturalistic shading. The left-most painting is webbed with cracks, revealing the thin layer of gesso applied to the wood before painting. The handling of the paint suggests an inexpert artist who was unable to achieve the opaque surfaces common in the finest Ethiopian paintings. It also lacks a solid definition of lines or the precise modeling of figures, shading, or textiles characteristic of the Second Gondärine style, of which is attempts to imitate. The bright palette—neon yellow, Kelly green, black, red, pink, electric green, and blue—suggests the use of commercial paints, rather than locally-made ones, which would have been made from mineral and organic pigments. Despite the shortcomings of its execution, the images of Mary and St. George testifies to the longevity of the influence of the Gondärine style on Ethiopian Orthodox art. Additionally, the work has a noteworthy provenance, as it was gifted by Princess Hirut Desta (Ruth), granddaughter of the Emperor Haile Selassie, to Lila Wallace, co-founder of the American magazine Reader’s Digest.Kristen Windmuller-Luna, 2016Sylvan C.

The painting’s intimate size suggests it was intended for a domestic interior.

Together with another panel in the Robert Lehman Collection and panels in the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore, and the Národní Galerie, Prague, it formed part of a more extensive series on the life of Santa Francesca Romana, presumed to have been painted for the Church of Santa Maria Nuova in Rome. The complex of narrative scenes from which these panels come in turn formed the basis, in 1468, for a fresco cycle depicting thirty seven episodes from her life painted by Antoniazzo Romano or his workshop in the Oblate convent of Tor de' Specchi. The frescoes are thought to have been commissioned following the death of Santa Francesca Romana, when a case for her canonization was presented.Santa Francesca Romana, founder of the Olivetan Oblates, lived from 1384 to 1440. Her cult as a beata was authorized in 1460, and she was finally canonized in 1608. In the Lehman panel, she is presented in a white cloak kneeling before the Virgin and Child, both of whom hold inscribed scrolls. The Virgin wears a golden cloak, which Saint Paul at the left wraps around Francesca Romana. Paul also holds a scroll. The scene takes place on a platform of cloud, and the Virgin and Child are surrounded by scarlet seraphim. At the right, Saint Mary Magdalene, cloaked in red, and Saint Benedict, in the foreground, hold a protective cloak around twenty members of the Olivetan order. Below the Gothic windows at left, an angel is engaged in carding golden threads with a warp and loom. Playing around the warp are two dogs and two cats. The narrative has been interpreted as signifying that the Oblate congregation was woven together by heavenly visions and was assailed by evil spirits in the form of cats and dogs, which were unable to break its threads.",,"Tempera on wood, gold ground"

The family group sits under an apple tree with a grape vine twisting around it. A lone apple sits centrally on a shroudlike blanket at the foot of the composition.

This fresco’s style, subject, and composition have roots in the arts of the Byzantine Empire in the eastern Mediterranean, brought by traveling artists first to Italy and from there to Catalonia.

At left and right, the archangels Gabriel and Michael serve as advocates for the faithful, while the three magi, the smallest figures, offer gifts in adoration.

She is shown here around the age of ten, one year before she was repudiated by her intended husband. The initials C and M within the border of Margaret's collar (backwards C in the left border) probably signify their union. The chain of gold shells on her headdress may be part of the armorial insignia of the Bourbon dynasty with which she was then associated. The elaborate pendant of a pelican piercing its breast to draw blood with which to feed its young (the blood represented by the large hanging ruby), a symbol of Christian charity, alludes to the sitter's piety. These elements are mounted on a gold fleur-de-lis. Demonstrably showing her faith, Margaret holds a large gold filagree Paternoster bead of her rosary and looks to the right, presumably toward (what was originally) the object of her devotion.

Thus, this is not a pendant to The Met’s two portraits of Talleyrand.

Under an architectural canopy at left, Jesus heals a blind man by touching the man’s closed eyes with two fingers of his right hand—a traditional Christian gesture of blessing. At right, Jesus brings Lazarus back to life. Accompanied by Saint John the Evangelist, Jesus gestures with an open left hand while pointing a cross-shaped staff in his right at the tightly shrouded Lazarus, who rises from his sarcophagus as his sisters, Mary and Martha, lift the lid. Sparely told, both stories are meant to emphasize human connection and evoke deep emotion (Mary and Martha’s faces are stained with tears). Although the two episodes do not occur sequentially in the Gospel of John, they may have been placed side by side here because they both communicate themes of rebirth and redemption.In the 1920s, restorers removed most of the frescoes from the walls of San Baudelio de Berlanga, leaving behind ghostly traces of the images that are still visible on the church’s walls today. The Cloisters acquired nine of these paintings from 1957 to 1961 but later returned six to Spain as long-term loans.

This iconographic type originated in litanies to the Virgin likening her to a field of grain nourishing humankind with the bread of life - a reference to the Eucharist and the sacrifice of Mary's son.  Beneath the Virgin are the arms of the bishop of Liège, whose diocese may have donated the window.  St. Catherine appears with her attribute, the wheel of her martyrdom; below her are the arms of the coopers' guild of which she was patron saint. St. Dorothea appears with her attributes, the Christ Child and a basket of roses; below her is a representation of the Trinity, echoed in the three flowers held by the saint.  St. Barbara appears with the tower of her martyrdom; below her are the arms of the city of Maastricht, the former capital of the diocese of Liège.",,"Pot-metal glass, white glass, vitreous paint, silver stain"

Here two knights, identified by their shirts of mail, are being falsely accused of treason and condemned by the consul. A third knight, the right arm of the consul, and the beginning of the inscription—[S N]ICO/ LAVS: PR[A]ESES/ MILITES (Nicholas protects the soldiers)—were lost when the panel was cut down at an undetermined time. In the second scene (acc. no. 1980.263.3), Nicholas responds to the knights' prayers by appearing before the counsul to plead for their release. A palace guard looks on from the left.The panels probably came from an ambulatory chapel dedicated to Saint Nicolas in the cathedral of Soissons, whose choir was under construction in the 1190s. This type of composition, in which each narrative element is framed under an arcade, is among the earliest known examples of its kind and is strongly associated with Soissons.

About 1608, Carlo Saraceni, a Venetian influenced by Caravaggio, painted this replacement that was also rejected.

The diptych was likely painted by a member of Giotto’s workshop in Naples, who was active on the frescoes in the Church of Santa Chiara. Giotto's Neapolitan workshop may have continued to operate after he returned to Florence in 1333. The monumentality of the figures, which protrude outside the painted framework, together with their expressive gestures of grief, intensify the dramatic quality of this work, which was probably made for private devotion.

In the nineteenth century, the monks had to sell the books, which eventually were cut up and divided among collectors. From this single initial, it is easy to understand Niccolò's fame. He infused the harrowing scene of the stoning of Stephen with elegance-in the lines of flowing drapery, touches of gold, and vibrant color. At the same time, he intensified the drama by compressing five figures and an outsized throne into the confines of the letter and then, after the scene was painted, emphatically separating the evil men from the saint with the finishing pink stroke of the crossbar of the E.",,"Tempera, gold, and ink on parchment"

This panel likely formed the central pinnacle of a multi-tiered altarpiece, perhaps that portraying the Madonna and Child with Saints Domninus, John the Baptist, Peter, and Anthony Abbot (Museo Diocesano, Empoli). In depicting the Crucifixion, the artist has excluded the numerous figures traditionally incorporated into the narrative, such as the crowds of soldiers, the mourning Holy Women, and the Thieves, thereby reducing the composition to include only the Virgin and Saint John. Contemplating Christ’s sacrifice, they are portrayed seated on the ground, for compositional or dramatic effect.

Written in the early fifth century after the sack of Rome by the Visigoths, Augustine, bishop of Hippo in north Africa, expanded the concept of the Church as a spiritual, heavenly City of God as opposed to the material, earthly City of Man. Even in times of upheaval, man should fix his eyes on the heavenly Jerusalem rather than earthly, political matters for, in the end, empires would fall and God alone would triumph. While the thesis is framed by this conflict of the material and the spiritual, throughout the twenty-two chapters, Augustine digresses into discussions of the flaws of pagan religions, the turpitude of the Romans, the original sin, the natures of the Cities of God and Man, and many other related themes upon which he wished to expound. In this manuscript copy of the City of God, the text of each chapter or book begins with a major decorated initial, is enriched with abundant marginalia throughout, and ends with a brief exposition or interpretation of the preceding text. The punched and tooled bindings appear to be contemporary with the manuscript.",,"Tempera and gold on parchment, tooled leather binding"

The leaf shown here comes from a manuscript that was disassembled in the 1870s. This frontispiece image depicts a lamb (an image commonly associated with Christ) tormented by the spear and sponge used against Christ during the Passion.

The image would have faced the opening lines of the text for the Common of Virgins. The location and orientation of the image within the book is confirmed by the text on the back of this miniature, which is the end of the Common of Confessors—a section that traditionally precedes the Common of Virgins. Marmion has divided the leaf into three scenes, each of which illustrates part of the text of the Common of the Virgins. Among the figures in all three scenes is the abbess of a religious order, identifiable by her black habit, whose identity and meaning have yet to be unraveled.This book must have been lavishly illustrated, since full-page miniatures in the Common of Saints section, like this one, were rare. The generous use of gold leaf further underscores the expense of the original manuscript, which was begun for Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, in 1467, and finished in 1470 for Charles the Bold, Philip's son and successor. A surviving document indicates that the manuscript had 624 folios, 95 miniatures, and was illustrated for the ducal court by Simon Marmion and his workshop.

In her outstretched right hand, she grasps a palm branch, a symbol of martyrdom. In her left hand, she holds a chalice and host. She is flanked by heaps of symbolic objects and attributes that contrast earthly riches and pleasures with the instruments of her torture and martyrdom. The landscape below the saint is the setting for two narrative vignettes and a sacred allegory. On the left is the martyrdom of St. Barbara at the hands of a turbaned executioner who is struck by lightning as he swings his sword. Behind them is the tower where, according to legend, Barbara was sequestered by her pagan father in an unsuccessful effort to keep her from both suitors and Christian proselytizers. The tower’s three windows, one of which Barbara caused to be added, make symbolic reference to the Trinity. On the opposite side of the canvas is a deathbead scene that almost certainly depicts St. Stanislaus Kostka receiving the Viaticum from an angel after invoking St. Barbara. The scene exemplifies St. Barbara’s role as patroness at the hour of death, intervening to assure that last sacraments are received. In the central scene, the Lamb of God (Agnus dei) stands on a mound at the center of an enclosed garden (hortus conclusus). The lamb bleeds into a chalice, which overflows in four streams (an allusion to the four rivers of Paradise) and irrigates the garden plots below. The phrase ""Vinum germinare faciens Virgines,"" inscribed above the lamb, is taken from the prophecy of Zacharias (9:17): ""For what is the good thing of him, and what is his beautiful thing, but the corn of the elect, and the wine springing forth virgins.""

Dürer’s haunting devotional painting depicts Saint Anne, who was particularly venerated in Germany, with the Virgin and Child. Anne’s hand on her daughter's shoulder takes on a consolatory meaning, and her distant gaze suggests a premonition of Christ's Passion.

At least twenty-five years later the artist added boards to the oak panel and painted the Baptist’s parents, Saints Elizabeth and Zacharias, and an angel on the left. Their more painterly style contrasts with the Caravaggesque modeling of the earlier figures. The cartouche, inscribed ""If the root be holy, so are the branches"" (from Saint Paul’s Epistle to the Romans) was added during the second stage of work.

Ménageot's quick brushwork creates an atmospheric, gray space, and the dark clouds in which the Virgin and Joseph sit loosely convey a sense of bulk and mass, whereas the table and foreground elements are more dryly executed. Infrared photography shows stiff outlines in the underdrawing, suggesting that Ménageot employed a transfer process to lay down the design, yet did not follow them exactly with the oil paint.Ménageot, who studied with both Jean Baptiste Henri Deshays and François Boucher, won the prestigious Prix-de-Rome in 1766 and became the director of the Académie de France in Rome in 1787.

In 1514 Weydacher became record keeper of the vast Schwaz (Tirol, Austria) silver mines, which were financed by the Fugger family of Augsburg and were the source of great wealth for the Emperor Maximilian I. Like many other Schwaz families, whose wealth and social status derived from the silver mines, Weydacher commemorated his union by donating this armorial panel to the glazed cloister of the local Franciscan monastery, where it was installed in the window in the northeast corner. Directly opposite the window was a large wall painting commissioned by Weydacher who appears as donor supporting a shield with his arms. A Franciscan context is further indicated by the central image of the Virgin and Child on a crescent moon in an aureole surrounded by a glory of angels amidst clouds signifying Santa Maria degli Angeli, the parish church outside of Assisi and the birth place of the Franciscan Order. The glazing of the cloister was removed at an early date and although other analogous panels are recorded this appears to be the only one to survive. The design is attributed to Augsburg artist Leonhard Beck. The artist who executed the figures employed only a point of brush, light wash and a fine pointed stylus defining forms and volumes with remarkable economy and linear finesse. The palette of glass dominated by cerulean blue, deep red and golden hues of silver stain brings vibrant radiance to the panel while the composition skillfully balances the heraldic shields, the holy personages and the architecture that frames them. Of the highest quality and of great rarity, this panel, which is essentially secular but comes from a monastic context, constitutes a significant and appropriate addition to The Cloisters collection.",,Colorless and pot-metal glass with vitreous paint and silver stain

They may have been part of a larger series, since there is no reason —  biblical or historical —  to show Saint Agnes and Saint Jerome together (the pairing may reflect the patrons’ given names, however). Both Agnes and Jerome were popular subjects in the religious art of Spain. Jerome is shown, pen in hand, writing a book, presumably his Latin translation of the Bible, known as the Vulgate. His robe has the ermine-fringed collar of a cardinal and his hat hangs on the wall behind him; the head and a paw of the lion he befriended after extracting a thorn peek out beneath his arm. The virgin martyr Agnes holds her attribute, a lamb. Jerome is often depicted alone, but since he was one of the Four Fathers, or Doctors, of the Church, he may originally have been joined by three male saints and four female saints, to make a series of eight. Whether as a pair or as many as eight, the roundels could have been decorations for one of the large retables, or altar shelves, that filled churches during this period, but their sumptuous nature would also have suited a palace. The richly carved and painted garlands of fruit and flowers, a type of ornament popularized in glazed terracotta work by the Della Robbias in Italy and widely imitated in Europe, would have brought the saints into harmony with a secular interior.As a medium for sculpture, alabaster was often used in northeastern Spain, where it was quarried.[1] Even such a costly material as alabaster was frequently painted in the Renaissance. While the natural beauty of the stone is left unadorned in the carefully chiseled striations of Jerome’s sleeves, the fur of his cloak, or the billows of Agnes’s dress, most of the reliefs’ surfaces have been defined by color. Dark green leaves contrast with white and red fruit and flowers in the garlands; carnation hues blush on Agnes’s cheeks and gold highlights her tresses, while tones of black emphasize Jerome’s gnarled beard; and gilding picks out the hems and ermine tails of their robes. Without pigment, the windmill and low-relief landscape behind Agnes would lack visual clarity. Spanish wood sculpture was routinely painted, and the roles of entallador (carver) or escultor (sculptor) were clearly separated from that of the encarnador (painter of flesh tones) or estofador (painter of draperies). While wooden sculpture was completely covered with paint and required the hand of several specialists, alabaster was more selectively painted, and possibly a single artist —  quite likely not the carver —  was responsible for the coloring here. Diego de Siloé’s Virgin and Child (ca. 1519 – 28, Victoria and Albert Museum, London) is another example of the partial painting of alabaster: only hair, drapery, and facial features received coats of pigment. The carving of these roundels is most attractive, and the coloration complements rather than detracts from the sculptor’s skill. Jerome’s bony fingers and gaunt cheekbones deliberately contrast with the voluptuous smoothness of Agnes’s flesh. The textures of their hair and the swelling forms of the fruit were brilliantly rendered by chisel first, and only then enhanced by the painter’s finesse. Both sculptor and painter must have delighted in the trompe l’oeil fly that has just landed on Jerome’s book. Jerome’s torso, bursting from the garland’s confines, reflects trends of Mannerist art in Spain in the middle of the sixteenth century. Stylistic traits and material clues (such as the use of alabaster) suggest that the roundels were made in the region of Aragon. James Rorimer thought that Damián Forment, a famous Spanish sixteenth-century artist active in Poblet, Huesca, and Saragossa might have executed them.[2] Other scholars have offered attributions to sculptors less well known than Forment. John Goldsmith Phillips found similarities between them and sculptural work on the sacristy doors of Cuenca Cathedral, which Manuel Gómez-Moreno thought were possibly by Diego de Tiedra.[3] Although none of these attributions has been agreed upon, recent scholars have continued to locate the roundels’ place of origin in Aragon rather than Castile.[4][Ian Wardropper.

At the upper right, Saint Augustine converses with a boy who says that filling a hole in the sand with the sea is no more difficult than explaining the Trinity; and in the lower right, Saint Augustine preaches. In the windows behind the altar at the right are kneeling figures of a man and woman, along with coats of arms.

They may have been part of a larger series, since there is no reason —  biblical or historical —  to show Saint Agnes and Saint Jerome together (the pairing may reflect the patrons’ given names, however). Both Agnes and Jerome were popular subjects in the religious art of Spain. Jerome is shown, pen in hand, writing a book, presumably his Latin translation of the Bible, known as the Vulgate. His robe has the ermine-fringed collar of a cardinal and his hat hangs on the wall behind him; the head and a paw of the lion he befriended after extracting a thorn peek out beneath his arm. The virgin martyr Agnes holds her attribute, a lamb. Jerome is often depicted alone, but since he was one of the Four Fathers, or Doctors, of the Church, he may originally have been joined by three male saints and four female saints, to make a series of eight. Whether as a pair or as many as eight, the roundels could have been decorations for one of the large retables, or altar shelves, that filled churches during this period, but their sumptuous nature would also have suited a palace. The richly carved and painted garlands of fruit and flowers, a type of ornament popularized in glazed terracotta work by the Della Robbias in Italy and widely imitated in Europe, would have brought the saints into harmony with a secular interior.As a medium for sculpture, alabaster was often used in northeastern Spain, where it was quarried.[1] Even such a costly material as alabaster was frequently painted in the Renaissance. While the natural beauty of the stone is left unadorned in the carefully chiseled striations of Jerome’s sleeves, the fur of his cloak, or the billows of Agnes’s dress, most of the reliefs’ surfaces have been defined by color. Dark green leaves contrast with white and red fruit and flowers in the garlands; carnation hues blush on Agnes’s cheeks and gold highlights her tresses, while tones of black emphasize Jerome’s gnarled beard; and gilding picks out the hems and ermine tails of their robes. Without pigment, the windmill and low-relief landscape behind Agnes would lack visual clarity. Spanish wood sculpture was routinely painted, and the roles of entallador (carver) or escultor (sculptor) were clearly separated from that of the encarnador (painter of flesh tones) or estofador (painter of draperies). While wooden sculpture was completely covered with paint and required the hand of several specialists, alabaster was more selectively painted, and possibly a single artist —  quite likely not the carver —  was responsible for the coloring here. Diego de Siloé’s Virgin and Child (ca. 1519 – 28, Victoria and Albert Museum, London) is another example of the partial painting of alabaster: only hair, drapery, and facial features received coats of pigment. The carving of these roundels is most attractive, and the coloration complements rather than detracts from the sculptor’s skill. Jerome’s bony fingers and gaunt cheekbones deliberately contrast with the voluptuous smoothness of Agnes’s flesh. The textures of their hair and the swelling forms of the fruit were brilliantly rendered by chisel first, and only then enhanced by the painter’s finesse. Both sculptor and painter must have delighted in the trompe l’oeil fly that has just landed on Jerome’s book. Jerome’s torso, bursting from the garland’s confines, reflects trends of Mannerist art in Spain in the middle of the sixteenth century. Stylistic traits and material clues (such as the use of alabaster) suggest that the roundels were made in the region of Aragon. James Rorimer thought that Damián Forment, a famous Spanish sixteenth-century artist active in Poblet, Huesca, and Saragossa might have executed them.[2] Other scholars have offered attributions to sculptors less well known than Forment. John Goldsmith Phillips found similarities between them and sculptural work on the sacristy doors of Cuenca Cathedral, which Manuel Gómez-Moreno thought were possibly by Diego de Tiedra.[3] Although none of these attributions has been agreed upon, recent scholars have continued to locate the roundels’ place of origin in Aragon rather than Castile.[4][Ian Wardropper.

Ansanus is the city’s patron saint and holds its black and white banner. The format of the polyptych was highly unusual in that the central image, the Madonna and Child, was the same size as the flanking panels, allowing the entire altarpiece, which was intended to be portable, to be easily folded and moved. In the fifteenth century, Simone's panels were incorporated as the central elements of a larger altarpiece in the principal chapel of the Palazzo Pubblico, Siena's town hall. Simone's refined technique and descriptive powers, evident in the realistic manner in which Saint Ansanus grasps the staff, earned the praise and friendship of the poet Petrarch (1304–1374). The rectangular frames—rare at this date—are original.The altarpiece's five panels are, left to right: Saint Ansanus (Robert Lehman Collection, MMA), Saint Peter (Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid), Madonna and Child (Robert Lehman Collection, MMA), Saint Andrew (European Paintings, MMA), and Saint Luke (J.

As Queen of Heaven, the Virgin is seated on a throne; the plants that have overgrown it allude to her humility (humus, the latin root of humble, means earth).

Granscay explained the rationale for doing this, in reference to medieval armor, in an article published in 1928: ""Contemporary representations often show more detail than extant armor, which has been injured by rust and the loss of elements.

It is contemporary with the frescoes in the Cappella dei Priori of 1514 and, in its landscape setting and the figure types, depends on Fra Bartolomeo and Mariotto Albertinelli.",,Oil on wood

This delicate, fragmentary head of the Madonna relies closely on a painting by del Sarto of the Madonna and Child with the Young Saint John the Baptist that was probably painted around 1508 and hung in the Giustiniani collection in Rome in the seventeenth century.

Saint Nicholas of Tolentino was canonized in 1446 and wears the Augustinian habit. The altarpiece would have been completed with five pinnacles showing the evangelists and Christ, a base (predella) showing the history of Saint John the Baptist, and pilasters with small figures of saints. The archaizing style, with highly stylized figures on a gold background, is indicative of Giovanni di Paolo's preference for the work of his great fourteenth-century forebears.

As indicated by its rather modest dimensions, the picture probably hung in a domestic interior, where it would have served as a focus for daily prayer and devotion.
